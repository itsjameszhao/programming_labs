    "```\n",
    "This is a SYNCHRONOUS, BLOCKING call. The golden rule in asynchronous programming is that all components of the system must be asynchronous. Otherwise, the event loop will never regain control, causing your performance gains to be lost. The solution is to let the event loop know about this call by running it within the context of the executor, like so:\n",

The `await` keyword allows other async functions to execute concurrently and for their execution times to overlap. If isn't async, we do the same thing we did before. Now, we can handle async functions correctly. A note about this is that since functions are first-class citizens in Python, we can treat functions just like objects and do property checks on them and branching conditions to return different kinds of functions."
